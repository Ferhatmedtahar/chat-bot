### Project: Webpage Chatbot

This project is a chatbot application that allows users to ask questions about a webpage's content.

### Functionality

- Users enter a URL and a query.
- The application retrieves the webpage content.
- Webpage content is processed and stored in a vector database using Upstash for efficient search.
- Redis is used for task management and website indexing processes.
- A simple UI facilitates user interaction.
- The chatbot generates responses based on the indexed content of the webpage.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
cd your-repo-name
npm install
```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and include the following:

- `UPSTASH_URL`: Your Upstash URL
- `UPSTASH_TOKEN`: Your Upstash token
- `REDIS_URL`: Your Redis URL
- `PORT`: Port for the application (default: 3000)
- Other environment variables specific to your application

### Running the Application

1. **Start the Redis server:**

Ensure your Redis server is running.

2. **Start the application:**

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Project Structure

- **src:** Contains the application source code.
  - **components:** Reusable UI components.
  - **pages:** Main application pages (e.g., home, chat).
  - **utils:** Utility functions.
  - **services:** Services for interacting with Upstash, Redis, and other APIs.
- **data:** Stores processed webpage data (if not using Upstash exclusively).
- **config:** Configuration files (e.g., environment variables).

### Usage

1. Enter a URL in the provided input field.
2. Submit the URL to initiate webpage processing.
3. Once processing finishes, ask questions about the webpage content.
4. The chatbot will generate responses based on the indexed content.

### Additional Notes

- **Webpage Processing:**
  - A script or process retrieves webpages, extracts relevant information, and stores it in Upstash.
  - This part of the project might require additional configuration or dependencies depending on your implementation.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for network requests, database operations, and other potential issues.
- **Performance Optimization:** Consider optimizing webpage processing and search algorithms for better performance.
- **Security:** Ensure proper security measures to protect user data and prevent vulnerabilities.
